The goal of Samvera Camp is to introduce new developers to the skills and tools they will need to successfully build Samvera-based digital repository solutions.  There’s a lot of ground to cover and you won’t walk away at the end of the week a complete expert, but we hope we’ll have provided you enough of a scaffolding to jump-start your own work and keep learning like the rest of us.  We hope that the topics covered at Samvera Camp provide enough breadcrumbs that you’ll have a good idea where to start looking once you get home and start digging into problems on your own!

We encourage particpation from throughout the library and opensource communities.  In order to ensure that everyone can enjoy a safe, welcoming, and resprectful enviornment, please familiarize yourself with the [Samvera Community Code of Condct](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Code+of+Conduct).
